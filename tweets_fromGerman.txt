It's still my best scene I've ever seen in a movie up to Vandag

I'll never know why anyone else sees this shit ...

At least the film helps me sleep well

I bit in one day and then watched half of the first and second season again today because the woman hadn't seen it. Such a nice TV show, I would love to see a spin-off with Pat and Roxy or something about Sandy ... it seems like Tony but has the opposite attitude

Reality TV shows are all facts, man

Both excellent 80s children's television shows. I was a big fan of Fraggle Rock, which was a little strange since I had (and still have) dislike puppet shows like Rainbow and The Muppets (I know they were Jom Henson ...)

We have the TV show, we don't even need the film

It's WorldImmunizationWeek Vaccination is one of the most effective disease prevention methods. Vaccines protect against more than 25 life-threatening diseases such as measles, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, meningitis, influenza, tetanus, typhoid and cervical cancer.
$$$$$2
Vaccination protects us all. In emergencies, the risk of disease outbreaks such as measles, polio and meningitis increases. Vaccination protects us and protects our health workers. Make sure that you and your family are protected by vaccines. VaccinesWork
$$$$$2
Millions of children in the area are likely to miss life-saving due to COVID19. To combat the recurrence of other deadly diseases, we must continue to deliver vaccines where we can and immunize once the outbreak is under control.
$$$$$2
Investing in the fight against malaria supports the fight against COVID19 and saves the lives of the weakest:
pregnant women
children
$$$$$2
This model analysis reaffirms the WHO's call to maintain key life-saving services for the prevention, detection and treatment of malaria during COVID19. Countries must take advantage of this important window to ensure that malaria services are maintained.
$$$$$2
On WorldMalariaDay, we reaffirm our commitment to EndMalaria, a deadly disease that kills a child every two minutes. Let us tackle this disease together by ensuring that life-saving services for the prevention, detection and treatment of malaria are available to all.
$$$$$2
Zero malaria starts with me: Only 1 in 3 pregnant women in Africa have access to the 3 or more doses of preventive malaria therapy recommended by the WHO.
Let's increase access to preventive therapy for EndMalaria!
$$$$$2
The malaria toll will not stop when the COVID19 pandemic develops. A stable in action will bring unnecessary suffering and loss of life
$$$$$2
Investing in the fight against malaria supports the fight against COVID19 and saves the lives of the most vulnerable: pregnant women and children.
$$$$$2
Today is WorldMalariaDay 
Malaria still kills a child every two minutes. Children should not die because they do not have access to life-saving services to prevent, recognize, and treat the disease.
$$$$$2
Vaccines protect us from harmful diseases like polio and measles by:
Using our body's natural defenses to protect against infections
Training our immune system to form antibodies
$$$$$2
Our shared commitment is to ensure that ALL people have access to ALL tools to defeat COVID19.
$$$$$2
I am Sir Andrew Witty and Dr.
NOIweala
for accepting appointments as special representatives for the ACT accelerator. We face a common threat that we can only overcome with a common approach! COVID-19
$$$$$2
Nurses and midwives are vaccine champions for parents and expectant parents.
They offer important first contacts with vaccination services.
$$$$$2
In this WorldImmunizationWeek, we also remember the recent measles outbreak and ongoing polio outbreak in the Philippines, Filipin Bayrağı, and how our Bayanihan spirit has helped us respond to these threats by not leaving an unvaccinated child behind.
$$$$$2
In 2018, 86% of children under the age of five were vaccinated with a dose of the measles vaccine, compared to 72% in 2000 and 20% in 1980.
$$$$$2
Before the COVID19 pandemic, the world had made immense progress in vaccinating children. In 2018, 86% of children under the age of five were vaccinated with three doses of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3). VaccinesWork for everyone!
$$$$$2
We have agreed to work together to ensure equitable access to ventilators worldwide and to give priority to countries with fragile health systems. We will also work together to train health workers on how to use these products to combat COVID19.
$$$$$2
But even with an accelerated process, developing a vaccine against COVID19 will take some time. Precautions are now essential to protect us from diseases, including diseases for which vaccines already protect children and adults.
